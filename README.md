# German-Car-Sales-Analysis
This project presents a data-driven analysis of over 7,000 used cars listed in the German market. It aims to uncover key insights into how vehicle attributes‚Äîsuch as brand, mileage, fuel type, and transmission‚Äîinfluence pricing and market behavior. The findings support better understanding for analysts, marketers, and automotive stakeholders.

# üîç Overview
The analysis was performed on a cleaned dataset of 7,784 car listings, each detailing aspects like brand, model year, mileage, transmission type, segment, and fuel type. The core of this project focused on:
1. Brand-wise pricing and distribution
2. Transmission preferences and patterns
3. Mileage influence on price
4. Fuel type adoption rates
5. Segment-wise valuation

# üí° Why This Project is Useful
This project provides key insights into the dynamics of the used car market in Germany by analyzing thousands of vehicle listings across various brands, conditions, and specifications. Understanding patterns in attributes like mileage, fuel type, transmission, and brand allows businesses to make informed pricing and inventory decisions. It also supports marketing efforts by highlighting shifts in consumer demand, such as preferences for automatic vehicles or interest in electric and hybrid options.
In addition to its business relevance, this project is a strong example of real-world data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization. It shows how thoughtful preprocessing and segmentation can turn raw data into clear, actionable insights. Aspiring analysts can use it as a practical reference for developing automotive dashboards and mastering data storytelling in Power BI.

# üìÇ Access the Dataset
The dataset used for this project is included in this repository under the name **german_cars_data**. It contains structured data on over 7,000 used cars, with attributes such as price, mileage, brand, fuel type, and transmission. You can download or clone the repository to explore the dataset and build on the analysis.

# üìä Key Findings
* Volkswagen dominates listings with the highest total price contribution.
* Automatic transmission is preferred, making up 74% of the dataset.
* Mileage clusters mostly between 20k‚Äì50k km and 50k‚Äì100k km, reflecting typical resold vehicle usage.
